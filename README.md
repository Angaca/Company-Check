# Company Check

A simple website that allows you to check a certain number of companies plotted onto a map and a table to see more information about those companies.

The whole website is made with React, having the map and the table on different pages using React Router. The map is created via Google Maps React Api that provides Marker and InfoWindow at the click of those markers. I have used Axios to get the companies and update all my needed React states.

All the visual part is made with MUI and some vanilla CSS; the whole app is mobile-first and can be used in different screen sizes, for an optimal view of the table on mobile please use the horizontal orientation.

The hosted version is available via NetlifyÂ [here](https://company-check.netlify.app/).

To run the app locally please see the Build.md file.
